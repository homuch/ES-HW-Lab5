# Embedded Systems Lab 5: PWM Waveform Generation for Real-World Applications

This repository contains the solution to **Lab 5: PWM Waveform Generation for Real-World Applications**. The project demonstrates **PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) waveform generation** on an **STM32 microcontroller**, with waveform observations displayed via a logic analyzer.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this lab is to explore **PWM techniques and applications** by generating PWM waveforms suited to a real-world application. The following requirements were addressed:

1. **Research**: Understanding PWM, its techniques, and various applications by consulting online resources.
2. **Application Choice**: Selecting an application that leverages PWM, based on personal interest.
3. **Waveform Generation**: Implementing PWM waveforms corresponding to the chosen application on the STM32.
4. **Waveform Observation**: Displaying generated waveforms using a logic analyzer for analysis and demonstration.

## Results 
We used the LED1 on our STM32 board to show our application of PWM. The LED becomes a breathing light, with the luminance goes up and down in a period of 2Hz.
We also use the Zeroplus logic analyzer to examine our PWM waveform:
